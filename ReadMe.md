# CFDepot

Prompt listed below. Originally looking at this project, my first thoughts were: Oh, this is a test of polymorphism knowledge. When I began designing it with each tool being an extension of a Tool abstract class, it seemed like it wasn't a scalable solution at all - not procatical. So, i wanted to add some key features to make it a more realistically scalable system.

  - SQLite - used to give our data some permanence, and gives us querying capabilities throughout the project
  - Ckasses we could easily add new tools to, making it scalable
  - An interface that allows the user to take advantage of the scalable features

That being said, I may have completely overthought this project. Looking forward to hearing back on critiques and constructive criticisms.
